# NAME

sendkey - send user input events to applications

# SYNOPSIS

sendkey [-wxodh]

# DESCRIPTION

*sendkey* reads user input events on stdin and injects them in the event queue so that they are sent to applications.
The expected format is described in *keyboa*(5).
If none of *-wx* is given, the default is

- *-w* if Windows mode is supported
- *-x* otherwise

# OPTIONS

*-w*
	Windows mode: Inject events using Windows API.

*-x*
	X11 mode: Inject events into X11 session.

*-o*
	Print events on stdout, in the form they are interpreted.

*-d*
	Dry run: Do not inject events.

*-h*
	Print help and exit.

# WARNINGS AND BUGS

Keyboa is in alpha stage. The CLI interface to *sendkey* and its input format *keyboa-API* will not be stable until the release of keyboa version 2.0.0.

Currently, *sendkey* does not support the "primpixel" coordinate system (i.e. the win_pointerx_primpixel and win_pointery_primpixel fields in pointermove events.)
Since this is the coordinate system used by *listenkey*, it means that mousemove events cannot be piped directly from *listenkey* to *sendkey*.

Under some circumstances, *sendkey* can cause the Windows desktop to lock when sending a `mousemove` event, requiring the user to log in again.
